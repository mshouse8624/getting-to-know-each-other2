                <h3>Hobbies and Activities: more information</h3>
                <p>My favorite activity is playing video games and I like playing either by myself or with friends.  Another thing 
                    I love to do is travel.  I love going on vacation with my family and just being able to be some place different 
                    and to experience something different is very cool to me.  My dream one day is to go to Italy and spend a few days 
                    checking out Italy and just taking in the atmosphere.  I also love to be active and basically play any sport.  My
                    favorite sport to sport would have to be basketball as I just love the fast pace nature of the game.  Since I like 
                    to be active, I do love to go for walks and bike rides a lot.
