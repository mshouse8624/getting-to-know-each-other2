                <p>My recent job was working at Jewel Osco as a Liquor Associate which conisted of stocking shelves and managing the inventory
                    I also then during the summer of 2022 still working at Jewel took another position, along side the Liquor Associate, to
                    be a Scan Coordinator.  That meant I would have to come in early on Tuesday and Wednesday to verify that the new sales
                    came through and to hang up tags around the store.  The system they also used for the tags as well as other functions used
                    Linux, so that was one of my first introductions to Linux in the real world.

                <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                <p>A fun fact about me is that I run a tiny lawn mowing business.  I have been cutting lawns since 2017 and then recently
                    expanded it to a business in 2021.  I cut a total of 5 lawns right now and at the highest I had 6 lawns to cut.
